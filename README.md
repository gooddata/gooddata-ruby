# GoodData Ruby wrapper and CLI

A convenient Ruby wrapper around the GoodData RESTful API. The gem comes in two flavors.
It has a CLI client and it is a library which you can integrate into your application.

The best documentation for the GoodData API can be found using these resources:

 * http://docs.gooddata.apiary.io/
 * http://developer.gooddata.com/api
 * https://secure.gooddata.com/gdc

## Note on Patches/Pull Requests
 
* Fork the project.
* Make your feature addition or bug fix.
* Add tests for it. This is important so I don't break it in a
  future version unintentionally.
* Commit, do not mess with rakefile, version, or history.
  (if you want to have your own version, that is fine but bump version in a commit by itself we can ignore when we pull)
* Send us a pull request. Bonus points for topic branches.
