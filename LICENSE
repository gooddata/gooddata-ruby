7. Limitations of Warranties and Liability
THE SOFTWARE AND ITS SOURCE CODE IS PROVIDED "AS IS" WITHOUT ANY WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND. TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, GOODDATA DISCLAIMS ANY IMPLIED WARRANTIES, INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, ANY IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NON-INFRINGEMENT OF INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS.  YOU MAY BE ABLE TO EXERCISE ADDITIONAL WARRANTY RIGHTS OFFERED BY THIRD PARTY COMMERCIAL SOFTWARE VENDORS WHOSE COMPONENTS ARE USED BY THE SOFTWARE.  IN THOSE INSTANCES, YOUR SOLE REMEDY AND RECOURSE SHALL BE AGAINST THE LICENSORS OF SUCH COMMERCIAL SOFTWARE, AND NOT AGAINST GOODDATA.

TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, IN NO EVENT WILL GOODDATA BE LIABLE FOR ANY LOST PROFITS OR BUSINESS OPPORTUNITIES, LOSS OF USE, BUSINESS INTERRUPTION, LOSS OF DATA, OR ANY OTHER INDIRECT, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF OR FROM THE SOFTWARE OR YOUR USE OF THE SOFTWARE, UNDER ANY THEORY OF LIABILITY, WHETHER BASED IN CONTRACT, TORT, NEGLIGENCE, PRODUCT LIABILITY, OR OTHERWISE. BECAUSE SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OR LIMITATION OF LIABILITY FOR CONSEQUENTIAL OR INCIDENTAL DAMAGES, THE PRECEDING LIMITATION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU. GOODDATA'S LIABILITY ARISING OUT OF THE SOFTWARE PROVIDED HEREUNDER WILL NOT, IN ANY EVENT, EXCEED US$100.00.

THE FOREGOING LIMITATIONS SHALL APPLY TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, REGARDLESS OF WHETHER GOODDATA HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES AND REGARDLESS OF WHETHER ANY REMEDY FAILS OF ITS ESSENTIAL PURPOSE.

8. Export Control. The Software is provided subject to the U.S. Export Administration Regulations and the regulations of other jurisdictions (e.g., the European Union). Diversion contrary to applicable law is prohibited. Without limiting the foregoing, you agree that (i) you are not acting on behalf of any person who is a citizen, national, or resident of, or who is controlled by the government of any country to which the United States or other applicable government body has prohibited export transactions (e.g., Iran, North Korea, etc.); (ii) you are not acting on behalf of, any person or entity listed on a relevant list of persons to whom export is prohibited (e.g., the U.S. Treasury Department list of Specially Designated Nationals and Blocked Persons, the U.S. Commerce Department Denied Persons List or Entity List, etc.); and (iii) you will not use the Software for any purpose prohibited by applicable law.

9. Indemnification You agree to defend, indemnify and hold harmless GoodData, and any of its directors, officers, employees, affiliates, subsidiaries or agents, from and against any and all claims, losses, damages, liabilities and other expenses (including reasonable attorneys' fees), arising from or related to: i) your use of the Software; ii) any derivative works you create using Software source code, and iii) your breach of this Agreement.

10. Governing Law These terms are governed by the laws of the State of California and the United States of America without regard to conflict of laws principles. You may not assign any part of this Agreement without the prior written consent of GoodData. Any attempted assignment without consent shall be void. These terms constitute the entire agreement between you and GoodData with respect to the Software and supersede all prior written or oral communications, understandings and agreements. Any waiver of these terms must be in writing to be effective. If any provision of these terms is found to be invalid or unenforceable, the remaining terms will continue to be valid and enforceable to the fullest extent permitted by law.
