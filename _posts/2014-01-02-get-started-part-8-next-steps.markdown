##Thank you
You just finished a tutorial that introduced you to basics of using SDK and getting around the project and you are on your path of becoming GoodData master. We have covered a lot of ground and if you have endured until now we have to thank you.

##What next?
Not all that is available in SDK was covered and not all that is available on the APIs is exposed through SDK. You should browse the Reference Guides that covers all that is available in SDK in a succinct manner but with some examples. If you are hardcore developer tests are always great source of usage examples (link to git). We would also love to hear about your use cases, successes or possible failure so we could improve the SDK for you.
