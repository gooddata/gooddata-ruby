module GoodData
  module Mixin
    # When an RSpec test like this fails,
    #
    #   @my_array.should == [@some_model, @some_model2]
    #
    # RSpec will call inspect on each of the objects to "help" you figure out
    # what went wrong. Well, inspect will usually dump a TON OF SHIT and make trying
    # to figure out why `@my_array` is not made up of `@some_model` and `@some_model2`.
    #
    # This little module and technique helps get around that. It will redefine `inspect`
    # if you include it in your model object.
    #
    # You can define a whitelist of methods that inspect will dump.
    # It will always provide `object_id` at a minimum.
    #
    # To use it, drop it in spec/support/inspector.rb and class_eval the models to
    # override `inspect`.
